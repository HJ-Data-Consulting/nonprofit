# Grants platform

A purpose-built intelligence engine for discovered and tracking nonprofit funding opportunities in Ontario.

## Purpose
In a fragmented funding landscape, this platform bridges the gap between nonprofit needs and available capital. By leveraging advanced AI-powered ingestion and a high-scale analytical warehouse, we provide a unified source of truth for grant seekers.

## Principles
- **Accuracy**: Parsing of unstructured grant data ensures financial figures and deadlines are always current.
- **Scale**: Architected with a production-grade OLTP/OLAP split for high-performance discovery.
- **Integrity**: Full data residency in Canada to meet the compliance needs of the nonprofit sector.
